Objective

Set up your project using Vite and React.
Create your very first components (Header, About, Skills, Projects, Footer) for the portfolio
Add some basic info about yourself

Steps


Install Prerequisites

Ensure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Use node --version in your terminal to check if it&rsquo;s installed properly.





Create a New Vite Project

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. In your terminal, run:

cd path/to/your/directory
Example: cd ~/Documents/Projects


Open your terminal and run: npm create vite@latest
Enter the name of your project and then hit enter. I&rsquo;ll be naming mine awesome-portfolio
When asked to pick a framework, select React using the arrow keys and hit enter.
When asked to select a variant, select JavaScript using the arrow keys and hit enter.
If you haven&rsquo;t already, open your project in VSCode by typing code ./awesome-portfolio in your terminal (if it&rsquo;s set up in your PATH, don&rsquo;t worry if it doesn&rsquo;t work) or by launching VSCode, going to &ldquo;File&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Open Folder&hellip;&rdquo; &gt; and selecting the location where you created your portfolio.
Open your terminal in VSCode by hitting &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; in the top left menu and clicking &ldquo;New Terminal&rdquo;.
Install all dependencies by typing npm install. You might be asked if it&rsquo;s okay to install Vite (or maybe some npm things). If so, keep hitting enter to accept them and start installing.
Start the development server using: npm run dev, then ctrl&#43;click on the localhost link that shows up in the terminal to see a demo in your browser.

Problems? If you encounter errors, verify your Node.js version and installation.
Overwhelmed? That&rsquo;s totally normal. You&rsquo;re getting thrown in the deep end here. But don&rsquo;t worry, this is 100% within your capabilities, trust me. If you want a deeper look at what each of the files and directories within the project are, then go to the additional content at the bottom of the page for an in-depth breakdown.
For now, we&rsquo;ll be focusing primarily on App.jsx.





Edit and Create Your First Component

Delete everything from App.jsx, App.css, and index.css. Vite includes boilerplate code which we won&rsquo;t be needing.
In App.jsx, insert the following:



export default function App() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}


This is how you&rsquo;ll end up creating every component from now on: export default function {ComponentName}.">

It looks just like a function, but it actually is a powerful way to create reusable pieces of UI in React. Components let you break your interface into independent, manageable parts that can maintain their own state and be easily composed together.\nThe App component is particular is something you’ll see in every React app, and serves as the root component for the entire app!\nWhat you’re returning in this component looks a lot like HTML, but is actually a different language called “jsx”, which essentially just tells JavaScript to insert an h1 element into index.html.\nSave App.jsx and go check out your demo to see your changes. You should see something like this: Inside the src folder, create a new file called Header.jsx.\nAdd the following code to Header.jsx:\nexport default function Header() { return ( \u003cheader\u003e \u003ch1\u003eThis is the header component\u003c/h1\u003e \u003c/header\u003e ); } This defines a new component called Header. It follows the same structure as App.jsx, using export default so it can be imported elsewhere. Import and use Header inside App.jsx: import Header from \"./Header\"; // This is how we import components export default function App() { return ( \u003cdiv\u003e \u003cHeader /\u003e // This is how we use a component so it appears in our UI \u003ch1\u003eHello world!\u003c/h1\u003e \u003c/div\u003e ); } You can use Header any number of times in your code. Try copy and pasting a few times and saving App.jsx to see what happens. You should see something like this: Practice Challenge Create new components for your Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Footer sections.\nHero Section Includes a headline, a brief description, and a call-to-action button (like “Contact Me” or “View My Work”). Example input: “Hi, I’m [Your Name], a full-stack developer. I build web apps that solve real problems. Let’s work together!” About Section: Includes an image (e.g., a personal photo or avatar) and three sentences about yourself. Example input: “Hi, I’m [Your Name], a passionate developer from [Location]. I specialize in React and love tackling challenging problems. In my free time, you’ll find me hiking or working on side projects.” Skills Section: List of technologies or languages you’re proficient in (e.g., JavaScript, React, Python). Example input: A list of skills with accompanying icons or progress bars. You could create a list or use icons from a library like Font Awesome for each skill. Projects Section: Showcase a few personal or school projects you’ve worked on. Example input: “Project 1: To-Do List App - A simple task manager built with React and Redux. Project 2: Portfolio Website - A personal portfolio built using React and Tailwind CSS.” Each project can have a title, description, and link to the live project or GitHub repository. Footer Section: Contains contact info, links to your social media profiles, or a copyright notice. Example input: “Connect with me: [LinkedIn link], [GitHub link], [Email link].” You can also include a copyright message like “© 2025 [Your Name].” Import your new components into your App.jsx.\nThe challengiest challenge of them all: if you’ve completed the previous two challenges and have discovered that you’re repeating yourself in your code, then try extracting that repeated code into their own separate components. Check out the React Docs on how to pass information to your components.\nIf you’ve done all the challenges, it might look like this at the end: Congratulations! At this point, you’ve created your foundation for your portfolio project. It’s not a looker right now, but once we get to styling in the next session so we can really make it pop and look impressive.\nTo review, we went over how to create a Vite application using npm and node, removed the Vite boilerplate code to insert our own, created our own components and imported them into App.jsx, and added information to those components. Check out the additional content on the folder structure or some other resources to learn more about today.\nYou’ve done a great job!\nAdditional Content: Other Resources React Docs The React docs are absolutely heat. It’s packed with information and examples that will help you get a deeper understanding of how React works and how to use it efficiently. They have examples and challenges in every single part, and if you just spend a few hours going through it you’ll be well on your way to knowing a ton about React:\nReact Docs\nCSS Box Model This is for when we start styling our portfolio. You may be surprised to learn that you’ve got a solid foundation for your portfolio just from this session. However, in order to make the portfolio really pop, you’re going to need CSS (we’ll be using Tailwind next time). Integral to CSS is the box model, so I would recommend brushing up on that here: W3Schools Box Model\nFlexbox Froggy Also for when we start to style our website, the hardest part is undoubtedly going to be the layout. The CSS flex property has made our lives significantly easier, but there’s still a bit of a learning curve. Flexbox Froggy will make you a pro at using flex/flexbox through a fun game: Flexbox Froggy\nAdditional Content: Vite Project Structure Overview Below is an explanation of each file and directory in a base Vite + React project:\n📂 node_modules/ This folder contains all the dependencies installed via npm. You generally don’t need to manually edit anything inside this folder. It is automatically generated when you run npm install.\n📂 public/ The public folder is where static assets (like images, icons, or fonts) are placed. These files won’t be processed by Vite and can be referenced directly in your HTML.\n📄 vite.svg\nA sample SVG file included with Vite’s default template. 📂 src/ This is where the main application code lives.\n📂 assets/\n📄 react.svg\nAnother sample SVG file, typically used as the React logo. 📄 App.css\nStyles for the App.jsx component.\n📄 App.jsx\nThe main React component, serving as the entry point for the UI.\n📄 index.css\nGlobal CSS styles that apply to the whole app.\n📄 main.jsx\nThe file where the React app is initialized and rendered into the DOM.\n🔹 .gitignore Specifies files and folders that Git should ignore, such as node_modules and build files.\n📄 eslint.config.js Configuration file for ESLint, which helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards.\n📄 index.html The main HTML file that Vite serves. It includes a root where the React app is injected.\n📄 package-lock.json Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies for consistency across installations.\n📄 package.json Defines project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and configurations.\n📄 README.md A markdown file explaining the project, how to set it up, and how to use it.\n📄 vite.config.js Configuration file for Vite, allowing customization of the development server and build process.\n",

<li><strong>Problems?</strong> If you encounter errors, verify your Node.js version and installation.</li>
<li><strong>Overwhelmed?</strong> That&rsquo;s totally normal. You&rsquo;re getting thrown in the deep end here. But don&rsquo;t worry, this is 100% within your capabilities, trust me. If you want a deeper look at what each of the files and directories within the project are, then go to the <a href="#additional-content-vite-project-structure-overview">additional content</a> at the bottom of the page for an in-depth breakdown.</li>

<details>
    <summary>⬅️ Click the triangle for more info <code>App.jsx</code></summary>
    <p>This code above is called a <em>component</em>. It looks just like a function, but it actually is a powerful way to create reusable pieces of UI in React. Components let you break your interface into independent, manageable parts that can maintain their own state and be easily composed together.</p>
<p>The <code>App</code> component is particular is something you&rsquo;ll see in every React app, and serves as the root component for the entire app!</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re returning in this component looks <em>a lot</em> like HTML, but is actually a different language called &ldquo;jsx&rdquo;, which essentially just tells JavaScript to insert an <code>h1</code> element into <code>index.html</code>.</p>

</details>

<p>Congratulations! At this point, you&rsquo;ve created your foundation for your portfolio project. It&rsquo;s not a looker right now, but once we get to styling in the next session so we can really make it pop and look impressive.</p>
<p>To review, we went over how to create a Vite application using npm and node, removed the Vite boilerplate code to insert our own, created our own components and imported them into <code>App.jsx</code>, and added information to those components. Check out the <a href="#additional-content-vite-project-structure-overview">additional content on the folder structure</a> or <a href="#additional-content-other-resources">some other resources</a> to learn more about today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done a great job!</p>
<h1 id="additional-content-other-resources">Additional Content: Other Resources<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#additional-content-other-resources">#</a></h1>
<h3 id="react-docs">React Docs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#react-docs">#</a></h3>
<p>The React docs are absolutely <em>heat</em>. It&rsquo;s packed with information and examples that will help you get a deeper understanding of how React works and how to use it efficiently. They have examples and challenges in every single part, and if you just spend a few hours going through it you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to knowing <em>a ton</em> about React:<br>

<h3 id="css-box-model">CSS Box Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#css-box-model">#</a></h3>
<p>This is for when we start styling our portfolio. You may be surprised to learn that you&rsquo;ve got a solid foundation for your portfolio just from this session. However, in order to make the portfolio really pop, you&rsquo;re going to need CSS (we&rsquo;ll be using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> next time). Integral to CSS is the box model, so I would recommend brushing up on that here:

<h3 id="flexbox-froggy">Flexbox Froggy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#flexbox-froggy">#</a></h3>
<p>Also for when we start to style our website, the hardest part is undoubtedly going to be the layout. The CSS <code>flex</code> property has made our lives significantly easier, but there&rsquo;s still a bit of a learning curve. Flexbox Froggy will make you a pro at using <code>flex</code>/<code>flexbox</code> through a fun game:

<h1 id="additional-content-vite-project-structure-overview">Additional Content: Vite Project Structure Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#additional-content-vite-project-structure-overview">#</a></h1>
<p>Below is an explanation of each file and directory in a base Vite + React project:</p>
<h3 id="-node_modules">📂 <code>node_modules/</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-node_modules">#</a></h3>
<p>This folder contains all the dependencies installed via npm. You generally don’t need to manually edit anything inside this folder. It is automatically generated when you run <code>npm install</code>.</p>
<h3 id="-public">📂 <code>public/</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-public">#</a></h3>
<p>The <code>public</code> folder is where static assets (like images, icons, or fonts) are placed. These files won’t be processed by Vite and can be referenced directly in your HTML.</p>
<ul>
<li>📄 <code>vite.svg</code><br>
A sample SVG file included with Vite’s default template.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-src">📂 <code>src/</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-src">#</a></h3>
<p>This is where the main application code lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>📂 <code>assets/</code></p>
<ul>
<li>📄 <code>react.svg</code><br>
Another sample SVG file, typically used as the React logo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>📄 <code>App.css</code><br>
Styles for the <code>App.jsx</code> component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>📄 <code>App.jsx</code><br>
The main React component, serving as the entry point for the UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>📄 <code>index.css</code><br>
Global CSS styles that apply to the whole app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>📄 <code>main.jsx</code><br>
The file where the React app is initialized and rendered into the DOM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-gitignore">🔹 <code>.gitignore</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-gitignore">#</a></h3>
<p>Specifies files and folders that Git should ignore, such as <code>node_modules</code> and build files.</p>
<h3 id="-eslintconfigjs">📄 <code>eslint.config.js</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-eslintconfigjs">#</a></h3>
<p>Configuration file for ESLint, which helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards.</p>
<h3 id="-indexhtml">📄 <code>index.html</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-indexhtml">#</a></h3>
<p>The main HTML file that Vite serves. It includes a root <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> where the React app is injected.</p>
<h3 id="-package-lockjson">📄 <code>package-lock.json</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-package-lockjson">#</a></h3>
<p>Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies for consistency across installations.</p>
<h3 id="-packagejson">📄 <code>package.json</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-packagejson">#</a></h3>
<p>Defines project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and configurations.</p>
<h3 id="-readmemd">📄 <code>README.md</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-readmemd">#</a></h3>
<p>A markdown file explaining the project, how to set it up, and how to use it.</p>
<h3 id="-viteconfigjs">📄 <code>vite.config.js</code><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-viteconfigjs">#</a></h3>
<p>Configuration file for Vite, allowing customization of the development server and build process.</p>
